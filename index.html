        <h1>Gillian Torrecampo</h1>
        <p><em>Student at <strong><a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>I am currently a senior studying Information Technology & Informatics at <a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University</a></strong> in New Brunswick.
          I am determined to help people's visions come to life by using both my current skills in web development and enhancing those skills through real-world experience. Over the summer I had the
          opportunity to intern at a marketing and advertising network called <strong><a href="https://www.dentsu.com/">dentsu</a></strong> where I was hired as an Associate Developer for one of their agencies, <strong><a
              href="https://www.merkleinc.com/">Merkle</a></strong>. During my
          summer experience at Merkle, I was able to learn more about UI/UX design and work on an internal project aiming to turn an accessibility checklist into an easy to use internal microsite as a guide for all
          different roles
          to gain an understanding of why web accessibility is important.</p>
